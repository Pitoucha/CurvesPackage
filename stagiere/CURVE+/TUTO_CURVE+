# How to use snapanalysis?? #
#---------------------------#

!!!first of all curves+ should be installed and working on your computer!!!

Files:

cleananalysis :
Removes all files generated during the process tu start again.

GetAverageParam.sh:
Generates the average of parameters over all snapshots in XXX-average.dat

GetDNAParam
Compiled fortran script to generates DNA parameters data for each snapshots

GetDNAParam.f90
Fortran script to compile to generates DNA parameters data for each snapshots in XXX.dat

GetBasePairParam.sh

make_Intra-BP_plots
gnuplot script for plots of intra base pair parameters

extract500namd.sh
script bash to extract unique snapshots from a single file containing a list of pdb files

make_Backbone-S1_plots

 make_BP-Axis_plots
gnuplot script for plots of axis parameters

 make_Inter-BP_plots
gnuplot script for plots of inter base pair parameters

snapanalysis
the script that does everything at once




#---------------------------#
#         Procedure         #
#---------------------------#

0: Compile GetDNAParam.f90  using
gfortran -o GetDNAParam GetDNAParam.f90
!!!gfortran should be installed and working on your computer!!!

1: You need a dynamic of your DNA system loaded in VMD

2: Extract a series of snapshots and save the coordinates in pdb format using VMD and save them in a file called snapshots.pdb

3: use extract500namd.sh  to generate a single pdb for each snapshot as

./extract500namd.sh    AAA    BBB

with AAA the number of atoms in yout system and BBB the number of snapshots

4: generates all the data at once doing:

./snapanalysis  AAA  BBB  CCC  DDD  EEE  FFF

with AAA the number of the first snapshot, with BBB the number of incrementation between snapshots, CCC the number of the last snapshot, DDD the number of base pairs, EEE the number of the base pairsin your DNA system.
!!!you need all the files in the same folder with the snapshots!!!

#         Tips              #
#---------------------------#

* There are a lot of files I know but all of them are just needed to run the script, you do not even need to know what is inside :p but still all of them should be in the directory with your snapshots!!
* All the files have to be executable, if not, make them executable using: chmod    +x    file
* The snapshots should be necessarily called snapshot-AAA.pdb with AAA the number of the snapshot but this is usually not a problem since  extract500namd.sh does it for you.
* You have to know how to use gnuplot to be able to modify the make_* scripts to make your own data . . .
* . . . if not, you can directly use the generated data in your favorite plot maker. The names of the data are quite straigthforward to understand, AAA-BBB.dat with AAA the parameter and BBB the number of the base pair. In the file you will have column 1 the snapshot number and column 2 the value of the parameter.
